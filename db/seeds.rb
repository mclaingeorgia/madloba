How do you make sure they are really providing what they claim?<span class='caret'></span></a><div class='toggleable-list-text'><p>All services and service providers are reviewed by the Rehab GE team before you are able to search for them on the website. This means we have called, visited or checked the service through someone else to make sure they are real and actively providing the services they say they are.

What can I do?<span class='caret'></span></a><div class='toggleable-list-text'><p>Unfortunately there’s not a whole lot you can do. The instant message is sent to an email account, so it might be that the service provider is away or unable to reply at this time. Some service providers offer a different email address and telephone number on their information page. If you haven’t already, we suggest you give them a try.

What are all the colored markers with icons?<span class='caret'></span></a><div class='toggleable-list-text'><p>The colored markers indicate the category of service that is associated with the registered services.

You will still need to provide a working email address in order to sign up, but this is so we can make sure you are a real person using the website. We will not use your email address to send spam or any other promotional information, ever. Please read our <a href=\"privacy_policy\">Privacy Policy</a> if you want to know more about it.</p><p>If you are a service provider, you are also free to leave the contact details empty, but remember that the more contact information you provide, the easier it will be for people to find you. We understand that you may not want people to email your personal account, which is why we recommend using a company email address, or opening a new email account that you can use on Rehab GE.</p></div></li><li><a name='block-13'>13. There are so many services listed! How do you make sure they are really providing what they claim?<span class='caret'></span></a><div class='toggleable-list-text'><p>All services and service providers are reviewed by the Rehab GE team before you are able to search for them on the website. This means we have called, visited or checked the service through someone else to make sure they are real and actively providing the services they say they are. Making sure the information stays accurate and up to date is a little bit trickier, but we have a system in place to make sure the service providers are active in updating their information page on a regular basis.</p><p>If you see a service provider on Rehab GE that you think is giving the wrong information about their services or is no longer operational, please <a href=\"#todo\">Contact Us[TODO]</a> and let us know all about it.

You can do this by calling them, sending them an email or sending an instant message through the website. If it is convenient for you, you can even go there in person.</p><p>As much as we try to make sure that all the services registered on Rehab GE are still functioning and up to date, we acknowledge that some might still slip through the cracks. We also cannot guarantee the quality of the services they provide. If you see a service provider on Rehab GE that you think is giving the wrong information about their services or is no longer operational, please <a href=\"#todo\">Contact Us[TODO]</a> and let us know all about it. We will personally follow up every claim.</p></div></li><li><a name='block-15'>15. I sent an Instant message to the service provider. It’s been a long time and I still have no reply from them. What can I do?<span class='caret'></span></a><div class='toggleable-list-text'><p>Unfortunately there’s not a whole lot you can do. The instant message is sent to an email account, so it might be that the service provider is away or unable to reply at this time. Some service providers offer a different email address and telephone number on their information page. If you haven’t already, we suggest you give them a try.  If there is still no response, or you have a feeling that the service is no longer operational, please let us know <a href=\"#todo\">here[TODO]</a>.</p></div></li><li><a name='block-16'>16. What are all the colored markers with icons?<span class='caret'></span></a><div class='toggleable-list-text'><p>The colored markers indicate the category of service that is associated with the registered services. You will notice that some service providers are linked to more than one category – this is so that they are easier to search for. The colors themselves have no particular meaning, but the symbols do relate to the category in some way so that they are easily recognizable.</p><p>If you have any feedback or questions about the markers or the colors we have chosen, please <a href=\"#todo\">Contact Us[TODO]</a> and let us know what you think.</p></div></li><li><a name='block-17'>17.
